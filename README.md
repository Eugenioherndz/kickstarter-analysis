Data Analysis Report
The purpose of this report is to benefit visualizing the data in different categories. By creating charts, tables, graphs and formulas that can help to breakdown the data for a concrete summary. I performed the analysis by breaking down data for pivot tables, graphs, and using formulas. The biggest challenge I encounter was creating formular, with the help of a tutor and reviewing the recorded video of the call help me to understand better how the formulars can be use as well as seen videos in YouTube. 

The first conclusion for The Theater Outcome by Launch Date is that the successful has the highest range in the graphs. Also, in the month of May it shows the highest from the rest of the year.  Inconclusion of the Outcomes Based on Goal the failed data has the highest percentage. The limitation of this dataset is you will need to create another data table to eliminate the unnecessary data to complete the graph. Another possible graphs or table that could be created is two show the goal in successful from each country.
